The Outdoor Ventilation Standard research program produces independently researched, physics-grounded technical publications on outdoor cooking ventilation. Each paper addresses a specific topic within the broader challenge of capturing buoyant cooking plumes in open-air environments.

All research is governed by the [Research Program Charter v2.6](/governance/research-program-charter/), uses the controlled vocabulary defined in the [Glossary v1.1](/governance/glossary/), and follows the visual conventions established in the [Diagram Standard v2.1](/governance/diagram-standard/).

## P0 — Foundation

These papers establish the core physical models. All subsequent research builds on these foundations.

- [RB-001: Buoyant Plume Behavior from Barbecue and High-Heat Cooking Sources](/research/rb-001-buoyant-plume-behavior/) — Quantitative plume characterization for gas, charcoal, wood-fired, and pellet sources using Heskestad correlations and McCaffrey zone classification
- [RB-002: Entrainment and Lateral Plume Spread in Open-Air Environments](/research/rb-002-entrainment-lateral-plume-spread/) — Morton-Taylor-Turner entrainment rates, plume diameter at representative hood heights, outdoor margin factor K=1.70
- [RB-003: Velocity Decay and Near-Field vs. Far-Field Capture](/research/rb-003-velocity-decay-capture/) — Heskestad velocity decay curves, CFM lookup tables by source type and height, maximum mounting height analysis

## P1 — Core

These papers directly address primary research objectives, building on P0 foundations.

- [RB-004: Why Indoor Ventilation Assumptions Fail Outdoors](/research/rb-004-indoor-vs-outdoor-assumptions/) — Systematic analysis of assumptions embedded in ASHRAE 154, IMC, and UL 710 that do not transfer to open-boundary environments
- [RB-005: Impact of Hood Geometry on Capture Performance](/research/rb-005-hood-geometry-capture/) — Hood dimensions, overhang, lip height, internal baffling, and their effects on capture envelope and effective capture area
- [RB-006: Wind Interaction and Cross-Flow Effects](/research/rb-006-wind-interaction-crossflow/) — Briggs bent-plume trajectory, crosswind Froude number regimes, deflection tables for 8 sources x 5 heights x 6 wind speeds

## P2 — Applied

These papers translate physics into design implications and diagnostic frameworks.

- [RB-007: Failure Modes of Outdoor BBQ Hoods](/research/rb-007-failure-modes/) — Failure mode taxonomy with diagnostic criteria, correctable vs. design-locked classification
- [RB-008: CFM Requirements for Outdoor Cooking Ventilation](/research/rb-008-cfm-requirements/) — Physics-based CFM sizing methodology with outdoor correction factor K_CFM = 3.0
- [RB-009: Side Panel and Wind Baffle Effectiveness](/research/rb-009-side-panel-effectiveness/) — Panel configuration analysis, wind protection effectiveness, CFM-equivalent savings

## P3 — Frontier

These papers address gaps in existing knowledge, edge cases, and emerging questions.

- [RB-010: Gaps in Existing Standards, Codes, and Consumer Guidance](/research/rb-010-standards-gaps/) — Systematic review identifying where ASHRAE 154, IMC, and UL 710 are silent or misleading for outdoor applications
- [RB-011: Grease Aerosol Transport and Deposition in Open Environments](/research/rb-011-grease-aerosol-transport/) — Particle size distribution, Stokes settling velocity, deposition patterns, and fire risk in open-boundary conditions
- [RB-012: Thermal Radiation and Plume Interaction at Hood Surfaces](/research/rb-012-thermal-radiation-hood-surfaces/) — Radiant heat flux from cooking sources, thermal boundary layer effects, material temperature requirements
