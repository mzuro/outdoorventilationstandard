## Terms of Use

By accessing this website and its publications, you agree to the following terms.

---

## Purpose and Scope

The Outdoor Ventilation Standard publishes physics-based research on outdoor cooking ventilation. This research is intended for educational and informational purposes. It is designed to serve as a reference resource for engineers, designers, researchers, standards bodies, and informed consumers.

---

## No Professional Engineering Advice

The publications on this site do not constitute professional engineering advice, design specifications, or installation instructions. The research presents analytical findings derived from established physical principles and published correlations. It does not replace the judgment of a licensed professional engineer, HVAC designer, or code official.

- Do not use this research as a sole basis for equipment selection, system design, or installation decisions without independent professional review.
- All quantitative values are derived from models with stated assumptions and applicable ranges. Real-world conditions may differ.

---

## No Code Compliance Guidance

Analysis of ventilation standards (ASHRAE 154, IMC, UL 710, NFPA 96, and local building codes) is provided for research purposes. This analysis:

- Does not constitute a legal interpretation of any code or standard
- Does not provide compliance guidance for any jurisdiction
- Does not claim authority to modify, override, or supersede any published standard
- Should not be cited as a substitute for the standards themselves

Always consult the current edition of applicable codes and standards, and defer to the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) for compliance determinations.
