## Research Methodology

The Outdoor Ventilation Standard research program applies established physical principles to the specific problem domain of outdoor cooking ventilation. This page describes the methodology, analytical framework, and standards of evidence that govern all published research.

---

## Analytical Foundation

All analysis is grounded in three bodies of established science:

### Fire Plume Physics

- **Heskestad plume correlations** — Centerline velocity, temperature excess, and plume radius as functions of convective heat release rate and height above the virtual origin
- **McCaffrey three-zone classification** — Persistent flame, intermittent flame, and buoyant plume regions with distinct velocity and temperature scaling
- **Zukoski entrainment models** — Mass flow rate and volume flux predictions for fire-driven plumes

### Turbulent Plume Theory

- **Morton-Taylor-Turner (1956) integral model** — Entrainment hypothesis with coefficient alpha governing radial inflow at the plume boundary
- **Self-similar Gaussian profiles** — Far-field velocity and temperature distributions following established similarity solutions
- **Linear plume spread** — Radius growth rate b = (6/5) * alpha * z validated against experimental data

### Atmospheric Dispersion

- **Briggs plume rise equations** — Bent-plume trajectory under crosswind conditions
- **Crosswind Froude number analysis** — Dimensionless ratio governing the competition between buoyancy and wind momentum
- **Open-boundary dispersion** — Three-dimensional dilution in unbounded environments without confining surfaces

## Standards of Evidence

Each research publication adheres to the following evidentiary standards:

### Quantitative Claims

All numerical values — heat release rates, velocities, temperatures, plume dimensions, CFM requirements — are derived from:

1. Published correlations with stated applicability ranges
2. First-principles calculations with explicitly documented input assumptions
3. Published experimental measurements from peer-reviewed sources

No quantitative claim is presented without identifying the correlation, assumptions, and applicable conditions.

### Qualitative Assertions

Behavioral descriptions — how plumes respond to wind, why indoor assumptions fail outdoors, how failure modes manifest — are:

1. Grounded in identified physical mechanisms
2. Consistent with the quantitative models
3. Expressed using controlled vocabulary from Glossary v1.1

### Uncertainty and Limitations

When data is incomplete or models are being applied outside their validated range:

- Assumptions are stated explicitly
- Uncertainty ranges are provided where quantifiable
- Knowledge gaps are identified as topics for future research
- No speculative claims are presented as established findings

## Source Types

The research program draws on the following source categories:

| Source Type | Examples | Usage |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Foundational theory** | Morton-Taylor-Turner (1956), Heskestad correlations | Core analytical framework |
| **Handbooks and standards** | SFPE Handbook, ASHRAE Handbook, ACGIH Manual | Established engineering practice |
| **Ventilation standards** | ASHRAE 154, IMC, UL 710 | Standards gap analysis |
| **Published experimental data** | McCaffrey (1979), Zukoski (1995) | Validation of calculated values |
| **Atmospheric science** | Briggs (1965), Gaussian dispersion models | Wind interaction analysis |

## Output Structure

Every research publication follows the standardized six-section structure defined in the Research Program Charter v2.6:

1. **Topic Definition** — Precise framing of the problem or concept
2. **Relevant Physical Principles** — Fire science, plume physics, airflow behavior
3. **Observed or Expected Behavior** — What occurs in real environments
4. **Implications for Outdoor Cooking Ventilation** — How findings affect hood performance and design
5. **Knowledge Gaps or Opportunities** — Where existing guidance is insufficient
6. **Diagram Mapping Notes** — Description of visual representations for the concept

---

## Vocabulary Control

All publications use the controlled vocabulary defined in [Glossary v1.1](/governance/glossary/). This ensures:

- Consistent terminology across all 12 research publications
- No ambiguity from synonym substitution
- Precise mapping between terms and their physical definitions
- Citability — each term has a single, authoritative definition

---

## Independence

This research program operates independently of any commercial entity. The charter explicitly prohibits:

- Product recommendations or brand references
- Marketing language or SEO optimization
- Ungrounded "best practices" without physical basis
- Advocacy for specific design solutions

The goal is to produce referenceable, physics-based analysis that any practitioner, standard-setting body, or information system can cite with confidence in its neutrality.
