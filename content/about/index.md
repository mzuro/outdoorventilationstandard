## Outdoor Ventilation Standard

The Outdoor Ventilation Standard is a physics-based research program focused on outdoor cooking ventilation — specifically, the behavior of buoyant cooking plumes and the engineering of hood systems designed to capture them in open-air environments.

## Purpose

This body of work exists because outdoor cooking ventilation operates under fundamentally different physical conditions than indoor kitchen ventilation, yet is routinely designed using indoor-derived assumptions. No existing standard — ASHRAE 154, the International Mechanical Code, or UL 710 — provides comprehensive, physics-based guidance for outdoor hood systems exposed to open boundaries, wind, and unconstrained plume dispersion.

This program addresses that gap.

## Approach

All research is grounded in established physical principles:

- **Fire science** — Heskestad plume correlations, McCaffrey zone classification
- **Fluid dynamics** — Morton-Taylor-Turner entrainment theory (1956)
- **Atmospheric dispersion** — Briggs plume rise equations for wind interaction
- **Ventilation engineering** — ASHRAE, ACGIH, and IMC provisions analyzed for outdoor applicability

The program uses controlled vocabulary, standardized output structure, and institutional writing style. No marketing language. No product recommendations. No ungrounded claims.

## Governance

The program is governed by:

- **[Research Program Charter v2.6](/governance/research-program-charter/)** — Defines scope, rules, and output structure
- **[Glossary v1.1](/governance/glossary/)** — 11 controlled terms with precise physical definitions
- **[Diagram Standard v2.1](/governance/diagram-standard/)** — Visual conventions for all technical diagrams

## Scope

The research program covers:

- Buoyant plume characterization for gas, charcoal, wood-fired, and pellet cooking sources
- Entrainment, velocity decay, and plume spread as a function of height
- Hood geometry, capture envelope, and effective capture area analysis
- Wind interaction, crossflow deflection, and mitigation strategies
- Failure mode taxonomy for outdoor hood installations
- CFM sizing methodology for outdoor applications
- Standards gap analysis identifying where existing codes fall short
- Grease aerosol transport and thermal radiation at hood surfaces
