**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active — All Topics Complete
**Governing Document:** Outdoor Ventilation Standard Charter v2.6

This document defines the prioritized research topics for the Outdoor Ventilation Standard Research Program. Each topic is derived from the charter's Research Objectives and assigned a priority tier based on its foundational importance to the overall knowledge system.

## Priority Framework

| Tier | Criteria | Timeline |
|------|----------|----------|
| **P0 — Foundation** | Required before any other research can reference it. Establishes core physical models. | Immediate |
| **P1 — Core** | Directly addresses primary research objectives. Builds on P0 foundations. | Near-term |
| **P2 — Applied** | Translates physics into design implications. Depends on P0 and P1 outputs. | Mid-term |
| **P3 — Frontier** | Addresses gaps, edge cases, and emerging questions. May require original analysis. | Ongoing |

**Charter Objective:** Plume behavior from barbecue and high-heat cooking
**Scope:** Characterize the buoyant cooking plume generated by typical outdoor barbecue configurations (gas grill, charcoal grill, wood-fired, pellet smoker). Define heat release rates, plume temperatures, rise velocities, and entrainment behavior for each source type. Establish the transition from near-field to self-similar far-field plume behavior.
