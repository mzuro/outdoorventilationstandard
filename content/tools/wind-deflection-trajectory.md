This diagram shows how ambient crosswind deflects the buoyant cooking plume away from the hood's capture zone. Even moderate breezes (5 mph) can push the plume to the edge of hood coverage, and winds above 8 mph cause outright capture failure for unshielded installations.

## Key Findings

**3 mph is manageable.** At light breezes, the plume deflects approximately 7 inches at 30-inch mounting height — well within the recommended 17-inch overhang margin.

**5 mph is marginal.** The 12-inch deflection approaches the overhang limit. Gusts beyond 5 mph will intermittently push the plume outside the hood boundary, producing the characteristic gust-correlated smoke escape of FM-4 (wind-deflected plume escape).

**8 mph and above cause failure.** The 20-inch deflection exceeds any reasonable overhang. Side panels or wind baffles become mandatory at this exposure level.

**12+ mph is impractical for open hoods.** At sustained winds above 12 mph, the plume is laid nearly horizontal. No conventional canopy hood can capture this — physical enclosure is required.
