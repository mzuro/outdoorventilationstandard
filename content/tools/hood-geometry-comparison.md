This diagram compares three hood configurations over the same cooking source, showing why overhang — the distance the hood extends beyond the cooking surface — is the single most important design parameter for outdoor capture performance.

## Key Findings

**No overhang = ~50% capture.** A hood the same width as the grill misses the entire expanded plume perimeter. This is the most common failure mode (FM-1) in residential outdoor installations.

**Indoor-spec overhang (~8") = ~75% capture.** An indoor hood applied outdoors provides some improvement but still cannot contain the full plume, which has expanded to 41 inches at 30-inch height from a 36-inch grill. Without walls and ceiling to redirect spillage, the escaped plume is permanently lost.

**Recommended outdoor overhang (17") = ~95% capture.** The K=1.70 outdoor margin factor from RB-002 accounts for turbulent intermittency, puffing oscillations, and light wind deflection. This is the minimum recommended overhang for outdoor installations.

## Design Priority

RB-005 established the hierarchy: **geometry precedes airflow**. No amount of exhaust CFM can capture plume gas that is physically beyond the hood's boundary. Overhang must be sized first; CFM is determined after geometry is set.
