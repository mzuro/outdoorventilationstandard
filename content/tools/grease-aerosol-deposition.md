When the buoyant cooking plume escapes the hood (partially or fully), grease aerosol is carried into the surrounding environment. This diagram shows how particle size determines how far the grease travels and where it deposits.

## The Three Deposition Zones

**Zone 1: Coarse Droplets (>20 micron) — 0-3 feet.** The largest grease particles carry 50-80% of the total grease mass but settle rapidly due to their high Stokes settling velocity (0.01-0.3 m/s). These deposit on surfaces immediately adjacent to the cooking station — countertops, the hood exterior, nearby walls.

**Zone 2: Fine Aerosol (2.5-20 micron) — 3-30 feet.** Medium particles are carried further by wind before settling. These represent 20-50% of aerosol mass and constitute the PM2.5-PM10 fraction that is most relevant for both surface contamination and respiratory exposure. Adjacent structures, fences, and outdoor furniture within this range accumulate visible grease deposits over time.

**Zone 3: Ultrafine (<2.5 micron) — 30+ feet.** Submicron particles behave as passive gas tracers with negligible settling velocity. They carry less than 5% of total grease mass but are the primary respiratory health concern. These particles can travel hundreds of meters and are indistinguishable from general atmospheric PM2.5.

## Fire Risk Implications

Accumulated grease deposits from Zone 1 and Zone 2 on combustible surfaces (wood siding, vinyl, fabric awnings) represent a fire hazard. The accumulation rate depends on cooking frequency, source type (wood-fired produces the most aerosol), and capture efficiency of the installed hood.
