This diagram shows the dramatic improvement in capture performance when side panels are added to an outdoor hood installation. Panels are the single most effective post-installation intervention for wind-exposed sites.

## Key Findings

**Side panels reduce effective wind speed by 40-60%.** Within the recirculation zone created behind the panels, the wind speed drops to 20-40% of the freestream value. This moves many Exposed installations back into the Moderate wind class.

**Required CFM drops 28%.** The K<sub>CFM</sub> multiplier decreases from 5.75 (exposed, no panels) to 4.14 (exposed, with panels). For a gas grill medium at 30 inches, this means 841 CFM instead of 1,169 CFM — a 328 CFM reduction.

**Capture efficiency improves 25-35 percentage points.** An installation achieving only 40-60% capture without panels can reach 85-95% capture with properly sized side panels.

**Minimum panel depth: 50% of mounting height.** Panels extending at least half the distance from hood to cooking surface provide meaningful wind reduction. At 75% depth, diminishing returns begin.

## Panel Configurations

- **Two side panels (island):** Effective against lateral crosswind; minimal protection from front/rear wind
- **Three panels (sides + rear):** Best overall protection; blocks 3 of 4 directions; 60-75% average wind reduction
- **Three panels with wall (sides + wall-mount):** Most effective; wall provides rear barrier plus Coanda effect
