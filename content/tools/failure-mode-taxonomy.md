This reference card catalogs the six primary failure modes observed in outdoor barbecue hood installations. Each mode has a distinct physical root cause, observable symptom pattern, and corrective classification.

## How to Use This Diagram

**Observe the smoke escape pattern** during cooking, then match it to one of the six failure modes:

- **Symmetric escape from all edges** (still air) → FM-1: Inadequate Overhang
- **Diffuse, general escape; plume looks wide and weak** → FM-2: Excessive Mounting Height
- **Edge spillage that improves when blower speed increases** → FM-3: Insufficient Exhaust Rate
- **Directional, intermittent escape correlated with wind gusts** → FM-4: Wind-Deflected Plume Escape
- **Uneven capture with dead zones under the hood face** → FM-5: Geometry-Induced Spillage
- **Plume rises past the hood face without being drawn in** → FM-6: Momentum-Limited Capture

## Correctable vs. Design-Locked

The most important distinction: FM-1 and FM-2 are **design-locked** — they cannot be fixed without replacing the hood or fundamentally changing the installation. FM-3, FM-4, and FM-6 are **correctable** through blower upgrades, filter maintenance, or adding side panels. Getting this diagnosis right avoids wasted effort on interventions that cannot address the root cause.
