These visual tools translate the physics documented in the [Research Program](/research/) into practical, interactive references. Each tool is grounded in the Heskestad plume correlations and Morton-Taylor-Turner entrainment theory formalized in our foundational research papers.

All tools are self-contained, require no login, and can be freely linked or embedded with attribution.

## Interactive Calculator

### CFM Sizing Calculator

**Source:** [RB-008: CFM Requirements](/research/rb-008-cfm-requirements/)

Interactive calculator that computes the minimum exhaust airflow (CFM) for any combination of cooking source type, hood mounting height, and wind exposure class. Shows the complete calculation breakdown, height comparison charts, and indoor-vs-outdoor correction factors.

## Plume Physics Diagrams

### Velocity Decay Curves

**Source:** [RB-003: Velocity Decay and Capture](/research/rb-003-velocity-decay-capture/)

Centerline velocity decay from cooking surface to hood mounting heights for four source types. Shows the minimum capture velocity threshold (0.8 m/s) and the reliable capture zone.

### Plume Width by Height

**Source:** [RB-002: Entrainment and Lateral Plume Spread](/research/rb-002-entrainment-lateral-plume-spread/)

Plume capture diameter at five standard mounting heights for four source types. Shows why hoods must always be wider than the cooking surface they serve.

### Heat Release Rate Comparison

**Source:** [RB-001: Buoyant Plume Behavior](/research/rb-001-buoyant-plume-behavior/)

Total vs. convective heat release rates for all 12 outdoor cooking source types. Shows how convective fraction varies dramatically by fuel type — the key to understanding plume strength.

## Indoor vs. Outdoor Analysis

### Indoor vs. Outdoor Comparison

**Source:** [RB-004: Indoor vs. Outdoor Assumptions](/research/rb-004-indoor-vs-outdoor-assumptions/)

Side-by-side diagram contrasting plume capture in enclosed indoor environments (100% capture) versus open-boundary outdoor environments (40-60% capture). The foundational diagram explaining the standards gap.

## Hood Design & Performance

### Hood Geometry Comparison

**Source:** [RB-005: Hood Geometry and Capture](/research/rb-005-hood-geometry-capture/)

Three-panel comparison showing undersized, indoor-spec, and recommended outdoor hood configurations over the same grill. Demonstrates why overhang is the most critical design parameter.

### Side Panel Effectiveness

**Source:** [RB-009: Side Panel Effectiveness](/research/rb-009-side-panel-effectiveness/)

Before-and-after comparison showing how side panels restore partial confinement, reducing required CFM by 28% and improving capture efficiency by 25-35 percentage points.

## Environmental Effects

### Wind Deflection Trajectories

**Source:** [RB-006: Wind Interaction and Crossflow](/research/rb-006-wind-interaction-crossflow/)

Side-view diagram showing plume trajectories at five wind speeds (0-12 mph). Illustrates the critical wind speed at which the plume exits the hood's capture zone.

**[View Wind Deflection Diagram &rarr;](/tools/wind-deflection-trajectory/)**

### Grease Aerosol Deposition Pattern

**Source:** [RB-011: Grease Aerosol Transport](/research/rb-011-grease-aerosol-transport/)

Transport and deposition zones for grease aerosol in the missed plume region. Shows how particle size determines travel distance, from coarse droplets (0-3 feet) to ultrafine particles (30+ feet).

## Diagnostics

### Failure Mode Taxonomy

**Source:** [RB-007: Failure Modes](/research/rb-007-failure-modes/)

Visual reference card classifying the six primary failure modes of outdoor hood installations. Each mode includes root cause, observable symptom, and correctable vs. design-locked classification.
